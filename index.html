  <h2>Hanging Coffins, Sagada</h2>
  <p>
    It is a trek to get to the hanging coffins in Sagada, located deep in the northern Cordillera Mountains, but the sight is something most people in the world will never see. The hanging coffins, some centuries old, are suspended from the cliffs of the Echo Valley.

    A tour of Corregidor Island is a must-see for history buffs visiting the Philippines. The island played a significant role in World War II and was the location of several battles.

  <h2>Pagsanjan Falls, Laguna</h2>
  <p>
    The only thing more exciting than admiring one of the most notable waterfalls in the Philippines is traversing it in a dugout canoe. The Pagsanjan Falls waterfall is part of the Pagsanjan Gorge National Park. Your trip along the falls will take you upstream through tropical landscapes, where you will be able to swim in natural pools and pass through caves.
